# TuringMachine

The idea is that i have a talking skull-servant on my personal webpage which yer lads can chat with.
What is different is that it is a (nearly) perfect turing machine! 
Ask my servant about anything, my skills or cv and it will answer,
or i shall throw his bones underwater for fish to live in , Yarrrr

##What is so cool about it
You would never understand if the skull is a machine or a human being because the operator will be able to respond himself 
using a simple - yet real-time - messaging system with simple controls as to the content!

####This project is under construction

I will be adding more features when i have the time and expand the prototype with more cool stuff

####What's missing

* Endpoint operators' dashboard
* Websockets for communication
* Algorithm for the skull-servant responses

####Modular library
I will be trying to build a modular library for the avatar and messaging systems,
so that anyone will be able to use it. Got any advices? Feel free to send me an email!

####Contributions

feel free to clone this repo and do whatever you like about it. Its only a fun project to play with!
